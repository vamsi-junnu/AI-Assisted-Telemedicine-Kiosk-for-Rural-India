Abstract:
  Existing System:
    Shortage of healthcare professionals: Insufficient number of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals in rural areas.
    Long distances and lack of transportation: Patients have to travel long distances to reach healthcare facilities, often without access to reliable transportation
  Proposed Solution:
    Al-assisted telemedicine kiosks: Deployment of Al-assisted telemedicine kiosks in rural areas, equipped with medical diagnostic tools and communication technology.
    Remote consultations: Patients can consult with healthcare professionals remotely via video conferencing, reducing the need for physical travel.

Objectives:
  Enhance Healthcare Access: Increase access to medical consultations and diagnostic services in remote and underserved areas of rural India where healthcare infrastructure is limited.
  Promote Health Education: Provide health education materials and resources through the kiosk to empower communities with information on preventive care and common health issues. 
  This impacts telemedicine kiosk on healthcare delivery, patient outcomes, and healthcare access in rural communities
